'@faustwp/wordpress-plugin': minor
---

Added new filter `faustwp_public_redirect_status_code`, allowing WordPress plugins and themes to choose the [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to use when generating redirects when the [enable public route redirects](https://faustjs.org/docs/faustwp/settings#enabling-public-route-redirects) setting is active.
